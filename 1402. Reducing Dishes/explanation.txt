We are given a list of satisfactions of each dish and the time taken to prepare them.
For every item, we have the choice of either choosing or not choosing.
    if we choose the item then the value will be (satisfaction[i]* t + {remaining part of problem with index incremented by 1 and time incremented by 1} (t+1))
    if we dont choose the item then the item is skipped, but the time will not be spent on this, so time will be same. (t)

so recursion comes out to be:
        max(satisfaction[i]* t + recur(i+1,t+1), recur(i+1,t))
