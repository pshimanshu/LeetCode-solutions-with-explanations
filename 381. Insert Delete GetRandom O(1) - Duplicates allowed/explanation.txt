Multiset:
    An unordered collection of elements, in which the number of occurences of an element may be one or more than one or zero.


We need to create the following methods of the class:
RandomizedCollection()
bool insert(int val)
bool remove(int val)
int getRandom()

RandomizedCollection():
        Creates an instance of a data structure, which stores the values of our multiset.
        
bool insert(int val):
        inserts the value 'val' to our multiset
        returns True if its multiplicity is 1
        returns False if its multiplicity is greater than 1, i.e. it already exists

bool remove(int val):
        removes the value 'val' from our multiset if present and returns True
        else returns False
        
int getRandom():
        the proabaility of an element being returned depends on its multiplicity
        therefore let us put the index as the variable instead of the value, and uniformly select one random number in range(0,len(data_structure) as index
        for elements with multiplicity greater than 1, the number of indices are also greater than 1, and hence will increase the chance of that element being returned
